MrFishIt was created by Nesox, a member of the OwnedCore forum, who released the first version in 2008[^1^]. Since then, he has updated it several times to keep up with the changes in WoW patches and servers. The latest version, MrFishIt v1.0.4, was released in 2015 and works on WoW 2.4.3[^2^]. You can download it from various sources online, such as 4shared[^3^], Mega[^4^], or Cheats.is[^6^]. However, be careful of viruses or malware that might be attached to some downloads. You can use a tool like VirusTotal to scan the files before running them.
 
To use MrFishIt, you need to have .NET Framework 3.5 installed on your computer. Then, you just need to extract the files to any folder you like and launch the program. You will see a user interface with several options and buttons. You can adjust the settings according to your preferences, such as the fishing spot, the lure type, the logout timer, etc. Then, you need to press the start button and choose the WoW process from the list. If there is none in the list, you can press refresh or click on the list. You can also hide or minimize WoW if you want. Make sure you have auto-loot enabled in WoW settings or use the injected feature for looting in MrFishIt.
 
MrFishIt is a handy fishing bot for easy farming in World of Warcraft. It can help you get gold, fish, and other items without much effort.
